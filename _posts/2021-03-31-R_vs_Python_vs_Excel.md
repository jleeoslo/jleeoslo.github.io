\-  There are many tools for data analysis. 

\-  Each tool has its own strength so that acknowledging the difference and smartly using different tools depending on situations is important for analysists.

 

## R

\- R has long been used for statistical analysis and visualization.

\- R provides abundant statistics functions.

\- Yet, as it is specialized in statistics, R is difficult to extend to other systems.

\- Relatively slow.

 

## Python

\- Not only for analysis, but also extensible to different systems for example using APIs.

\- Python has gotten great attention for its performance on deep learning (recently python usage has overtaken R usage).

\- Faster than R (but slower than Java or C).

\- Yet, Python is general purpose language in comparison with R which has clearer focus on statistics computation.

 

## Excel

\- Conventional spreadsheet program.

\- Easy to make reports clicking button.

\- Yet, data should be structured and the size of data matters.

 

## Then, which suits best for us?

\-  R when you have a project in which statistical accuracy greatly matters.

\-   Python if you need fast performance and you want various links with other systems.

\-   Excel if you need a quick report by using relatively less large and structured data.
