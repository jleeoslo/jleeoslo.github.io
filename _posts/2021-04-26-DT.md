## Decision Tree

- A Decision Tree is a tree-structured in which each internal node represents a criterion on an attribute , each branch represents the outcome of the criterion, and each leaf node represents a class label. 

- The following shows how certain data can be turn into a Decision Tree for classification.

- Decision trees can be applied to **classification** and **regression** problems. Each problem, a algorithm of recursive partitioning is applied such as **CART(Classification And Regression Tree), C4.5, C5.0, CHAID(Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection)**. The table below summarizes the details.

- Pros and Cons of Decision Tree
  
  - Pros:   (1) Most of all, Decision Trees are simple to understand and interpret. (2) Decision trees help to determine worst, best and expected values for different scenarios. (3) Decision trees don't require statistical assumptions (cf. LDA).
  
  - Cons: (1) Decision Trees are unstable;  a small change in the data can lead to a large change in the structure of the optimal decision tree. Then, the domain gap between training data and test data should be small for good performance. (2) Decision Trees are often relatively inaccurate. There are alternative models such as Random Forest to alleviate this problem. (3) Calculations can get complex. For instance, in the figure below, one decision boundary of linear regression is better at classifying dataset than the Decision Tree with three nodes.
