## Testing the significance of the correlation coefficient between study hour and score(n=9)

### (1) Opening the file

      TWO_CONT = read.csv('data/TWO_CONT.csv', fileEncoding='UTF-8')
      TWO_CONT
    
    ##   HOUR SCORE
    ## 1    0    60
    ## 2    4    78
    ## 3    3    83
    ## 4    6    74
    ## 5    6   100
    ## 6    7    80
    ## 7    8    90
    ## 8    8    85
    ## 9    3    70

There are two variables: study hour and score.



### (2) Drawing a scatterplot with trend lines

      plot(TWO_CONT, pch=16, col='dodgerblue')+
      abline(v=mean(TWO_CONT$HOUR), lty=2)+
      abline(h=mean(TWO_CONT$SCORE),lty=2)

The scatterplot implies that there is a positive correlation between study hour and score. Then, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient.



### (3) Using cor( ), calculating the correlation coefficient between study hour and score

      cor(TWO_CONT$HOUR, TWO_CONT$SCORE)
    
    ## [1] 0.7011677

The P-value 0.7 also indicates there is a positive correlation between study hour and score. Let’s do a statistical test(t-test) on this correlation coefficient.



### (4) *BEFORE using the t-test function*, let's try to find t-value and t-distribution manually following the t-test formula.

      cor(TWO_CONT$HOUR, TWO_CONT$SCORE)
    
    ## [1] 0.7011677
    
      r_xy = cor(TWO_CONT$HOUR, TWO_CONT$SCORE)
      r_xy
    
    ## [1] 0.7011677
    
      n = nrow(TWO_CONT)
      n
    
    ## [1] 9
    
      # the degree of freedom is set as n-2
      t_value = sqrt(n-2) * r_xy / sqrt(1-r_xy^2)
      t_value    
    
    ## [1] 2.601858
    
      pt(t_value, (n-2))
    
    ## [1] 0.9823353



### (5) Yet, using cor.test( ), one can easily obtain a summary of the test.

      cor.test(TWO_CONT$HOUR, TWO_CONT$SCORE)
    
    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  TWO_CONT$HOUR and TWO_CONT$SCORE
    ## t = 2.6019, df = 7, p-value = 0.03533
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.06933049 0.93151807
    ## sample estimates:
    ##       cor 
    ## 0.7011677

According to the P-value, the null hypothesis (no correlation) is rejected and it can be said that there is a relationship between study hour and score.



## 2. Testing the significance of the correlation coefficient between dad-son's height(n=1,078)

### (1) Opening the file

      heights = read.csv('data/heights.csv')
      head(heights)
    
    ##     father      son
    ## 1 165.2232 151.8368
    ## 2 160.6574 160.5637
    ## 3 164.9865 160.8897
    ## 4 167.0113 159.4926
    ## 5 155.2886 163.2741
    ## 6 160.0773 163.1752
    
      nrow(heights)
    
    ## [1] 1078



### (2) Drawing a scatterplot with trend lines

      plot(heights, pch=16, col='#3377BB77')+
      abline(v=mean(heights$father), lty=2)+
      abline(h=mean(heights$son),lty=2)

<center><img src ="/images/2021-04-08/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png></center>


### (3) Using cor( ), calculating the correlation coefficient between dad’s height and son’s height

      cor(heights$father, heights$son)
    
    ## [1] 0.5013383

There is a positive correlation(0.50) between dad-son’s height.



### (4) Using cor.test( ), testing the significance of the correlation coefficient.

      cor.test(heights$father, heights$son)
    
    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  heights$father and heights$son
    ## t = 19.006, df = 1076, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.4552586 0.5447396
    ## sample estimates:
    ##       cor 
    ## 0.5013383

This correlation is statistically significant according to the result of the t-test.
