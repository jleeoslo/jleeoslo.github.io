## Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)

- Linear discriminant analysis(LDA) is to find **a linear combination** of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events by using distributions of sample.

- From the figure below, the linear discriminant vector projected on LD1 classifies the sample well into two classes while the linear discriminant vector projected on LD2 does not.

- Two assumptions of LDA
  - Each class group is following a Gaussian distribution.
  - All the class groups share the same/similar covariance matrix(homoscedasticity).

- Decision boundary of LDA

  - Decision boundaries of LDA place where the difference of means of each class groups is large and the variance of each group of classes is small.

- Pros and Cons of LDA
  - Pros:   (1) LDA reflects the covariance structure of variables (cf. Naïve Bayes assume conditional independence). (2)  LDA operates relatively robust even if the assumptions are slightly violated.
  - Cons: (1) The size of the smallest group should be larger than the number of predictor variables. (2) It does not work well if it deviates greatly from the assumption of Gaussian distribution. (3) When class groups do not share the same/similar covariance matrix, we should use quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA).
